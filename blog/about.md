Software developer at [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk), currently working on [Mobile Oxford](http://new.m.ox.ac.uk).

Having a software engineering background, I am interested by the "Science of data" (Semantic Web, Knowledge Management, Information Retrieval, Data visualisation, localised search, crisis / emergency mapping...) and pervasive applications (Smart cities, Web of Things, Urban computing...). I am also interested by communication and marketing.
