Senior Software Engineer at [Qomben](https://qomben.com), I have been previously working
at [Weda](https://weda.fr), [Unlish](https://unlish.com) and at the
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk), mainly on [Mobile Oxford](https://m.ox.ac.uk).

Having a software engineering background, I am interested by the "Science of data"
(Semantic Web, Knowledge Management, Information Retrieval, Data visualisation, localised search,
crisis / emergency mapping...) and pervasive applications (Smart cities, Web of Things, Urban computing...).

As a software architect, I deeply believe in software craftmanship practices, Event-Driven architectures,
and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

[MSc Dissertation "Semantic Mashup to Query Localised Data"]({{ site.url }}/public/documents/msc-dissertation-filliau-2011.pdf) from my MSc in Computer Science at Oxford Brookes University.

CV available upon request.
