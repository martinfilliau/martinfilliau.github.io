title: Making links between paper notes and the "virtual world"
category: Technology

I want to take notes about a resource I am currently reading on my computer. How to make links between notes taken on paper and resources (URLs, files stored in computers...)?

Scenario:

1. I have QR codes stickers that I can stick on paper... let's say Livescribe DOT Paper.
2. I can configure the link to the resource of the QRcode with an application on my smartphone / computer.
3. When I write, my Livescribe pen recognize QRcodes. During synchronisation, link is recognised by the software and "replicated" in the numeric copy of my notes.

Problems:

- What if I want to write about a resource multiple times --> many QR codes to link one resource?

Alternatives:

- Write a special string (like a Twitter hashtag)
