                            is a fascinating book that navigates between reality
                            and fiction to explore the history of major figures
                            in science and technology. From John von Neumann,
                            pioneer of computer science and game theory, to Alan
                            Turing and Paul Ehrenfest, the author blends
                            historical facts and imagined stories to probe the
                            impact of their discoveries, between progress and
                            danger.

                            The book extends to the present day, looking back at
                            the historic 2016 match between Lee Sedol, one of
                            the greatest Go players, and AlphaGo, DeepMind's
                            artificial intelligence. This confrontation marked a
                            turning point, illustrating how machines can not
                            only surpass human intuition, but also redefine our
                            relationship with knowledge and creativity.

                            At a time when artificial intelligence is at the
                            heart of all discussions, with the AI Summit having
                            just ended in Paris, taking a step back from the
                            subject and returning to its roots seems more
                            essential than ever. Highly recommended reading!
