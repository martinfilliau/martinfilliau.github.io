                        <p>
                            A few months ago, I attended a coffee roasting
                            workshop at
                            <a href="https://montista.com" target="_blank"
                                >MONTISTA</a
                            >, and since then I have often thought about the
                            parallels with our work in IT.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just as a master roaster transforms green beans into
                            perfectly developed coffee, we transform raw
                            business requirements into software architecture
                            (functional, if possible).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each bean reacts differently depending on its
                            origin. Each component of our stack has its own
                            specific characteristics. A bad setting can ‘burn’
                            the architecture or leave it ‘underdeveloped’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The roaster knows exactly when to stop the roasting
                            process. We need to know when to stop optimising in
                            order to deliver on time, or when to modernise
                            before the ‘technical debt’ becomes unmanageable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both professions combine science and art, technique
                            and intuition.
